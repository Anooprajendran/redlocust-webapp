                      <h4>Information Collected from Other Sources</h4>
                      <p>We may also collect information about you from other sources, including from our third-party partners or service providers, publicly available sources or social networking sites.</p>
                      <p> We may combine this information with other information in our possession, which helps us to update, enhance, and analyze our Services, and provide tailored experiences for you.</p>
                      <h4>Social Plug-ins</h4>
                      <p>Social plug-ins (“plug-ins”) of social networks are used on our websites, in particular the “Share” or “Share with friends” button of Facebook, whose website: facebook.com is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, is responsible for Facebook.com in Europe. The plug-ins are usually marked with a Facebook logo. </p>
                      <p>Besides Facebook, we use plug-ins from “Twitter” (Provider: Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103), “LinkedIn” (Provider: LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA).</p>
                      <p>For data protection reasons, we have deliberately decided against utilizing direct plug-ins of social networks on our websites. For this reason, there is no automatic data transmission to social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn once you access our website.</p>
                      <p>Data will be transmitted to social networks only if you actively click on the respective social network button. In this case, your web browser starts a connection to the respective social network's servers. By clicking on the respective button (e.g. “Pass on”, “Share” or “Share with friends”) you agree that your browser will produce a link to the respective social network's servers and transmit usage data to the respective operator of the social network and vice versa. We have no influence upon the nature and extent of the data that is then gathered by the social networks.</p>
                      <p>The social network providers store the data collected about you as user profiles for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such an evaluation takes place in particular (also for not logged in users) for the representation of demand-fair advertisement and in order to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have a right of objection to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in providers to exercise this right. Through the plug-ins we offer you the possibility to interact with social networks and other users, so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. </p>
                      <p>The data is transferred regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in providers and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your data collected with us will be directly assigned to your existing account with the plug-in provider. If you click the activated button and, for example, link the page, the plug-in provider also stores this information in your user account and shares it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you log out regularly after using a social network, especially before activating the button, as this way you can avoid being assigned to your profile with the plug-in provider. </p>
                      <p>For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by the plug-in provider, please refer to the data protection declarations of these providers as notified below. They will also provide you with further information about your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy.</p>

                      <h4>YouTube Videos</h4>
                      <p>We have integrated YouTube videos into our website along with other video technology, which are stored on http://www.YouTube.com and other websites including https://hackerverse.tv,  and can be played directly from our website. These are all integrated in the “extended data protection mode”, i.e. no data about you as a user will be transmitted to YouTube, if you do not click on the videos to start playing them. Only when you play the videos the data referred to in the next paragraph will be transferred to YouTube. We have no influence on this data transfer.</p>
                      <p>By visiting the website, YouTube receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our Website. In addition, the data specified in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy will be transmitted. This is independent of whether YouTube provides a user account through which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your information will be directly associated with your account. If you do not wish to be associated with your profile on YouTube, you must log out before activating the button. YouTube stores your data as user profiles and uses them for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. Such evaluation takes place in particular (even for unlogged-in users) to provide demand-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact YouTube to exercise this right.</p>
                      <p>For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and processing by YouTube, please refer to the privacy policy.</p>
